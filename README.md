# SmartLight
This Arduino project uses Whisper for voice recognition to control an LED by using simple voice commands. The provided code recognizes commands like "turn on" and "lights on" to turn on the LED, while commands such as "turn off" and "lights out" will turn it off. An LCD screen will also display a message of the current state of the LED, such as "Light is on!" or "Light is off!"
